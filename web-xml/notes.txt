XEdit
Web based schema aware xml editor you can embed in your web application
This is built on top of xonomy.
see https://github.com/michmech/xonomy

What does the web based schema aware editor you open up need access to?
in domain url to ajax load xsd from
in domain url to ajax post updated xml doc to

/ mbx-xonomy.js - 3rd party editor, slightly updated

/ xs-docspec.js - tool for constructing xonomy docspec with xsd style rules

/ xsd-parser.js - parses an xsd file and builds a docspec from it using xs-docspec.js

mbx/rs-client.js - simple tool providing GET/PUT/DELETE/POST methods for an xml document from/to given url.
   One URL used here, same for all operations, just identifying the resource involved, using application/xml content-type.
   
xml-editor.js - pass it xml and xsd urls and it should open editor in a new/named window/iframe.
   save button handler
   save as local file button handler
   save schema as local file button handler

loaded xml should be search for xml schema reference attribute.
This schema should be used to launch xml editor.

TODO / BUGS   (KEY: + todo,  * doing,  x notdo,  ? maybe,  / done)

add support for element substitutionGroup (element names used as aliases for another element)
add support sequence of any
element specs appear for 'schema' AND 'xs:schema' among others ??? why
add support for import..
   This is in progress, docspec is parsed from schemaLocation ok, but the xml.xsd only has
   attributes and attributeGroup in it. These are added in the ctx as found objects only, not added to any element specs
   in the docspec, and even then their names aren't ns prefixed appropriately so referencing elements in the main xmlschema
   docspec can't find them. (I think)
<xs:import namespace="http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace" schemaLocation="http://www.w3.org/2001/xml.xsd">
* xml schema instance editor using schema from https://www.w3.org/2009/XMLSchema/XMLSchema.xsd 
/ xsd-parser.js build an xs-docspec instance from xsd xml read via xsm2js in Xonomy.
X xsd-parser.js should use promises to resolve references once all are available - doesn't really fit that model
