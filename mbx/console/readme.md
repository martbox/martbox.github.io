# console

This is a basic in-page console you can show/hide by clicking a yellow button.

I made this so I could still view console output on mobile devices that don't have one.

# Usage

Include the js in your page, and you'll see a big CONSOLE button appear.

Click this button to view console output, which is basically just a big text area with CLOSE and CLEAR buttons added.

If the console button happens to appear over the top of something you're trying to test, the positioning style attributes are set around line 100 so you can just move it somewhere more convenient.
